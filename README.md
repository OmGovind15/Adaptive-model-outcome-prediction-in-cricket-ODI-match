# Adaptive-model-outcome-prediction-in-cricket-ODI-match

The dataset is taken from https://cricsheet.org/matches/

 The work is being done on following two points: 
 
 1. Use of different ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, etc. to make
 binary as well as soft predictions of the winner of the match

 2. Switching of models over-wise as the match progresses based on their cross validation score.

Explainability will be used to analyse different features used for the match.

*This is not the final layout.*
The work is in progress ......
